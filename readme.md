# LAB | PowerBI Basics & Query 

## Exercise 1

Using `Invoices data`, follow the instructions seen in the lesson and your creativity to build your first PowerBI report.

- Insert as many charts as you know, and make tests with the other visualizations you don't know or we didn't see during the lesson. It is part of your learning.
- Manage the format of your visualization, titles of the pages and charts, color the background, apply filters, insert bookmarks. Enjoy and be creative!

## Deliverables
